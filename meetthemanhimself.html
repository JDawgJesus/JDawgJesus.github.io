    <h2>Biography/High School Career</h2>    
        <p class="lead">LeBron Raymone James is an American professional basketball player, who currently plays as small forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers. The only child of a 16 year old mother, Gloria Marie James, life was hard and struggling. The constant migration from house to house, made his future uncertain. At the age of 9, James was introduced to the sport of basketball from his football coach, Frank Waller. As a youth, James played for AAU's (Amateur Athletic Union) Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars, solidifying their position as a fan favorite on local and national levels. With his enrollment into St. Vincent/St. Mary Highschool, James and the Fighting Irish dominated the competition, with him averaging staggering numbers of 31 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals, throughout his senior year. The raw talent easily caught the attention of scouts, and writers who have dubbed him "the best high school basketball player in America right now". His appearences in Gatorade National Player of the year (HS), Sports Illustrated, and SLAM Magazine were a result of his outstanding play. James also played division 1 football as wide recivever.</p></div>

    <div class= "LBJBiotextbox2">
    <h2>Professional Career/Cavaliers</h2>
        <p class="lead">In 2003, hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers selected James as 1st pick in the 1st round overall of the 2003 NBA draft. His debut performance sparked much excitement as he finished with 25 points, eventually winning rookie of the year with averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 6 assists. The next year, James was selected to his first all star game in 2004-2005, finishing with 13 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists. Over the next 6 years, LeBron would rise to superstardom, and become one of the most (if not the most) dominant force in NBA. Finishing season and season with averages, more than 25 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists, transcending/surpassing many all star caliber players on opponent teams. However, there were moments where he fell short. His 2006 postseason debut helped lead the Cavs to victory in 5 games against the Washington Wizards, before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in round 2. In 2007 season, James adveraged 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 6 assists, leading his team thorugh playoff series', eventually to the final showdown in the NBA finals. However, this was short lived as the San Antonio Spurs swept the series 4-0. From 2008 to 2010, the Cavaliers would continue to make the playoffs, earning James back to back MVP titles in 2009, and 2010. Yet, they were unsuccessful in securing a championship title. By 2010, James had become an unrestricted free agent.

    <h2>The Decision/Miami Heat, Year of Controversy</h2>
        <p class="lead">On July 8th 2010, LeBron on an ESPN live exclusive dubbed "The Decision" that he would be "taking his talents to south beach, and join the Miami Heat". The high profile mannered announcemnt left many Cavaliers fans devasted, and infuriated/offended with his attitude, as many believed the "special" was unecessary. This drew intense criticism, and controversy from sports analysts, executives, and current/former NBA players, slowing his momentum down. The move to Miami teamed LeBron with Miami Heat superstar Dwyane Wade, former Toronto Raptors' star Chris Bosh. In his first season with the Heat, James bore a much angrier demeanor during matches. His return to Cleveland on December 2nd after the departure was met with only more negativity, as James was despised and booed every time he touched the ball. LeBron averaged 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists. Miami entered the playoffs as the second seed of the eastern conference, but suffered a bitter loss in the NBA finals against the Dallas Mavericks in 6 games lead by superstar power forward Dirk Nowitzki. James only averaged a meagre 17.8 points in that series. 
        </p>
    
    <h2>Championships/Miami Heat Years</h2>    
        <p class="lead">The next two years proved fruitful to James' career, the change in his play style, developing a more orienteered strategy tied the Heat franchise record for best start in history. James earned his 3rd MVP with 27.1 points, 8 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2 steals, and 1.9 points, locking down the first seed for the playoffs. The new transformation of LeBron contributed much towards winning 2 consecutive championships in 2012 and 2013, with teammate Ray Allen hitting a clutch 3 point jumpshot in game 6 of the 2013 finals series, in a rematch against the Spurs for James. LeBron was also rewarded with finals MVP for both championships. In 2014, James recorded a career high 61 points against the Charlotte Bobcats on March 3rd. James averaged 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.4 assists, before being denied of the Heats hope for a three-peat championship run by the Spurs, in a 5 game series. His finals averagers were 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2 steals.</p>
        
    <h2>I'm Coming Home/Reborn as a Cavalier</h2>    
        <p class="lead">On July 11th 2014, James announced that he would be returning home to the Cavaliers. After James signing, the transfer of Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, and resigning of all star Kyrie Irving formed a new trio. In a game agains the Timberwolves in Decemeber 2014, James became the Cavalier's all-time assists leader In January of 2015, James was plagued with injuries that caused him to miss a total of 2 weeks, playing only 69 games in the season. LeBron finished the season with 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists, finishing 2nd in MVP voting, only behind Golden State Warriors' guard Stephen Curry. Thoroughout the playoffs, the Cavaliers dispatched many teams including the Chicago Bulls in the Semi-finals, and Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference Finals, before earning a showdown with the Golden State Warriors, and their cpatain Stephen Curry. Unfortunately, injuries for Irving and Love stopped the Cavs from winning it all, despite LeBron's averages of 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists with serious finals MVP consideration. In the 2015-2016, Cavaliers head coach David Blyatt was fired, and many distractions arose surrounding LeBron's attitude, and change in composure. In the Cavs rematch against the warriors, the team's unbelievable victory after being down 3 games to 1, made them the first team in history to earn that achievement. In game 7, James recorded a huge, momentum shifting chasedown block on Andre Igudala, and 2 key free throws to secure the win in the clutch. With that, they ended the 52 year Cleveland sports curse, and fufilled his promise to bring a championship on home soil. </p>
    
    <h2>Present</h2>
        <p class="lead">James has continued to dominate after the sudden departure of teammate Kyrie Irving to the Celtics in the 2016-2017 free agency. With early struggles, James scored a season high 57 points against the Washington Wizards, and became the youngest player to score 29,000 career points at the age of 32. James recieved his first career ejection on November 28th 2017, following an arguement with the referees, and James' request for a foul call against the Miami Heat. Till this day, LeBron currently holds 62 career triple doubles, with more to come.</p>
